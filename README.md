FAKETRACE – AI-BASED MULTIMODAL DEEPFAKE DETECTION SYSTEM
“TRUST, BUT VERIFY.”
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The rapid growth of deepfake technology has created serious risks such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and loss of digital trust. Detecting manipulated
images, videos, and text has become extremely difficult for humans using manual
methods.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW:
FakeTrace is an AI-based web application designed to detect and analyze deepfake
content. Users can upload media files and instantly verify whether the content is
REAL or FAKE. The system uses AI-assisted forensic analysis to identify hidden
patterns, inconsistencies, and digital artifacts.

KEY FEATURES:
Image deepfake detection (MVP)
Simple and clean user interface
AI-powered forensic reasoning
REAL / FAKE classification with confidence score
Explainable AI output for better trust

TECH STACK:
FRONTEND: React + TypeScript
AI ENGINE: Google Gemini AI
ARCHITECTURE: Modular and extensible design
DEPLOYMENT: Hackathon-ready MVP setup

HOW IT WORKS:
UPLOAD CONTENT – User uploads an image or media file
ANALYZE DATA – System examines visual artifacts and inconsistencies
AI DECISION – AI classifies content as REAL or FAKE
DISPLAY RESULT – Output shown with confidence and explanation

FUTURE SCOPE:
Video deepfake detection using frame-level analysis
Audio deepfake detection using spectrogram-based AI models
Dataset expansion and model fine-tuning
Ethical AI safeguards and audit logging
FakeTrace is a hackathon prototype developed for educational and research
purposes only. AI-generated results should not be used as the sole evidence for
critical decision-making.
